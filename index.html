       <p>Interesting facts about bears</p>
       <ul>
       <li> Bears (Ursus species) are large, four-legged mammals that have a unique status in pop culture.<li>
                 <li>They are not quite as cuddly as dogs or cats; not quite as dangerous as wolves or mountain lions; but they are decidedly ever-compelling objects of fear, admiration, and even envy. </li>
        </ul>

        <a href="http://origami.me/chameleon/"><img src="chameleon.jpg" width=400 height=400></a>
        <p>Interesting facts about chameleons</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All chameleons are primarily insectivores that feed by ballistically projecting their long tongues from their mouths to capture prey located some distance away.</li>
            <li>Colour change in chameleons has functions in camouflage, but most commonly in social signaling and in reactions to temperature and other conditions. </li>

        <a href="http://origami.me/camel/"><img src="camel.jpg" width=400 height=400></a>
        <p>Interesting facts about camels</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Camels are very social, even though they might seem extremely laid-back and slow. In the wild, they travel with around 30 others when looking for food.</li>
            <li>A camel might appear to have thick fur, but its coat reflects the sun. This makes it ideal in the hot desert, and the camels don’t get too hot.</li>
            <li>Camels aren’t as slow as they look – they can run up to speeds of 40mph. However, they cannot maintain this for very long, but can comfortably move at up to 25mph.</li>
